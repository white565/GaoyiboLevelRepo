Here is provided bonus and experimental features.

//Blendshader-use this experimental shader with simple shapes carefully: it is only to use clearly near to the object. 
No shadow casting-other shadows going through it. 
Works on top of everything-characters too.(Exclude transparent objects)
(so use it in places there it will not contact with character or use simple colliders to close blendmesh)//

//Standard lighting version(Only built-in render pipeline supported)-may be preferred in some cases//
